## Voice-Based Inventory Management for Farmers

🌾 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered voice-based inventory management system specifically designed for farmers, enabling them to manage inventory without the need for reading or writing. The system uses lightweight language models (LLMs) and speech APIs to support native language interactions, ensuring accessibility even in low-resource rural environments.

✅ Current Progress

📌 Initial Phase
	•	Finalized and preprocessed dataset for initial model training.
	•	Original problem scope was reevaluated after expert feedback from Dr. Soma Dhavala.

🔄 Pivoted Focus
	•	Shifted project to a more practical and impactful application:
Voice-based inventory management system for farmers.

📅 Recent Developments
	•	Redesigned project roadmap to focus on voice interaction and accessibility.
	•	Started training lightweight LLMs tailored for conversational tasks.
	•	Integrated speech APIs for real-time voice input/output.
	•	System design now supports native language interaction, enabling farmers to use the system through simple voice commands.
