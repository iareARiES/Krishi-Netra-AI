# 🌾 AI-Powered Crop Health Monitoring – *Krishi Netra Inspired*

## 📌 Domain  
**Crop Monitoring**

---

## 🛠️ Problem Statement  
In the diverse agricultural ecosystem of India, early detection of plant diseases and assessment of crop nutritional health are critical for maximizing yield, minimizing losses, and ensuring long-term food security.  

However, most Indian farmers lack timely access to expert agronomic support, resulting in delayed intervention. Even when pest infestations are recognized, many do not know the type or treatment needed, leading to the misuse of agrochemicals—often harming crop growth and soil fertility.

## 🎯 Project Objective  
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based crop health analysis system that:

- Detects plant diseases using image-based analysis  
- Evaluates plant nutrition levels through visual cues and remote sensing  
- Uses satellite imagery to monitor early signs of crop stress  
- Integrates real-time weather data via APIs to enhance disease prediction  
- Suggests the right pesticide and quantity based on disease type  
- Recommends specific nutrients based on deficiency detection  

### 🎯 Targeted Crop Categories:
- High-Value Spice Crops  
- Cash Crops  
- Food Grains  
- Oilseeds  
- Plantation & Specialty Crops  
- Medicinal & Aromatic Plants  
- Fruits  

Our goal is to empower farmers with a user-friendly, real-time tool that detects diseases, diagnoses nutritional issues, and recommends precise treatments—saving crops, time, and money.
